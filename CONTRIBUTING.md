# Contributing Guide

For issue and PR templates, labels, and automated checks, see [Issues and Pull Requests](#issues-and-pull-requests).

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for the containerized dev environment
- [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) for toolchain and task management

### Install mise

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl https://mise.run | sh
# or
brew install mise

# Windows
winget install jdx.mise
```

## Quick Start

```bash
mise install       # Install toolchains (Go, Node, pnpm, sqlc, golangci-lint)
mise run setup     # Install dependencies and run code generation
mise run dev       # Start the full containerized dev environment
```

`mise run dev` launches the development stack in Docker:

1. PostgreSQL infrastructure
2. Database migrations, run automatically on startup
3. Connect-It API and admin UI
4. Go server with the in-process AI agent and containerd workspace backend
5. Web frontend with Vite hot reload

The dev stack uses `devenv/app.dev.toml` directly and does not overwrite the repo root `config.toml`.
Default host ports are shifted away from the production compose stack: Web `18082`, API `18080`, Connect-It `18421`, Postgres `15432`.

### Connect-It

The dev Compose files pull the pinned multi-architecture image
`ghcr.io/felinics/connect-it:0.3.0`; no Connect-It source checkout is required.
The image serves the API, MCP endpoint, and admin UI from one container.
Connect-It uses the same `memoh` PostgreSQL database as Memoh, with
its independently migrated tables isolated in the `connect_it` schema. The
schema is owned, created, and migrated by the Connect-It server itself on
startup; Memoh's migrations never touch it.

`mise run dev` shares a fixed development bootstrap token between both sides:
the Connect-It container seeds it as an API token at startup
(`CONNECT_IT_BOOTSTRAP_API_TOKEN`) and the Memoh server presents it as its
bearer token. The Connectors tab is therefore available from the first
startup, with no token minting or caching involved. The admin UI remains
available at `http://localhost:18421` with the development credentials
`admin` / `admin123`. The Connect-It port binds to loopback only: the token
is public, so the deployment must not be reachable from the LAN. If the
bootstrap token was revoked through the admin UI, rotate it once with
`MEMOH_CONNECT_IT_API_TOKEN=cit_<64 hex chars> mise run dev` — the new value
is seeded as a fresh token and the revoked one stays revoked.

Override the host UI port with `MEMOH_DEV_CONNECT_IT_PORT`, the public OAuth callback
address with `MEMOH_DEV_CONNECT_IT_BASE_URL`, or point at an external Connect-It
deployment with `MEMOH_CONNECT_IT_BASE_URL` and `MEMOH_CONNECT_IT_API_TOKEN`. For
image testing, override `MEMOH_DEV_CONNECT_IT_IMAGE`.

## Daily Development

```bash
mise run dev                              # Start all services
mise run dev:selinux                      # Start all services on SELinux hosts
mise run dev:down                         # Stop the dev stack
mise run dev:logs                         # View dev logs
mise run dev:restart -- server            # Restart a specific service
mise run bridge:build                     # Rebuild the bridge binary in the dev container
```

## Testing

Run focused tests before opening a pull request:

```bash
go test ./internal/channel/adapters/dingtalk
go test ./internal/...
pnpm test --run
pnpm --filter @memohai/desktop typecheck
mise run lint
```

For frontend-only changes, `pnpm lint` and `pnpm test --run` are usually enough. For desktop changes, also run `pnpm --filter @memohai/desktop typecheck`.

## SQL, API, and SDK Changes

Database changes target PostgreSQL:

1. Update `db/postgres/...`.
2. Add the next PostgreSQL incremental migration pair when the schema changes.
3. Update the canonical PostgreSQL baseline migration.
4. Run `mise run sqlc-generate`.

API handler changes should update the OpenAPI spec and generated SDK:

```bash
mise run swagger-generate
mise run sdk-generate
```

Generated files under `internal/db/postgres/sqlc/` and `packages/sdk/` should be committed only when they result from the matching SQL or API source changes.

## Windows Notes

The repository supports Windows development, but many `mise` tasks use bash-style scripts. Running them from Git Bash, WSL, or a Docker-backed shell is the smoothest path. Plain PowerShell is still useful for Go package tests and file inspection, but tasks that invoke shell scripts may need a POSIX-compatible shell.

If you have local work in progress that should not be included in a pull request, stage only the intended files:

```bash
git add path/to/intended-file.go path/to/intended-test.go
git status --short
```

## Issues and Pull Requests

Contributors can submit an issue or PR before format checks run. GitHub Actions validates the description, synchronizes labels, and requests corrections. PR lint, test, and build jobs run independently of description format. A separate controller approves pending first-time contributor workflow runs automatically. Workflow approval does not approve a code review, merge, or release.

### Label Configuration

`.github/labels.json` is the source of truth for label names, colors, and descriptions. New descriptions use English. GitHub does not read this file natively. The `Sync labels` workflow applies changes from main through the GitHub API. Routine synchronization creates or updates labels; it never deletes them.

```sh
# Preview the configuration without changing GitHub
node .github/scripts/sync-labels.mjs felinics/Memoh
# Apply the configuration
node .github/scripts/sync-labels.mjs felinics/Memoh --apply
```

The repository maintains these 14 labels:

| Group | Labels | Color |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Type | `bug` | `D73A4A` |
| Type | `feat` | `2DA44E` |
| Type | `test` | `8250DF` |
| Type | `help` | `0E8A8A` |
| Size | `size:XS`, `size:S`, `size:M`, `size:L`, `size:XL` | `0969DA` for all sizes |
| Scope | `change:web`, `change:desktop`, `change:migrations`, `change:server` | `D4C5F9` for all scopes |
| Correction | `needs:format` | `D97706` |

Issues use `bug`, `feat`, or `help`. PRs select exactly one primary type from `bug`, `feat`, or `test`. Classify documentation, configuration, and dependency changes as bug or feat according to their purpose; use test for changes dedicated to tests. Author identity belongs in the description, not in a label.

#### Size Calculation

Use the complete PR diff against its target branch. After excluding generated files, total additions as A and deletions as D. Classify by `max(A, D)`, never A+D. Each PR has exactly one size label.

| Label | `max(A, D)` |
| --- | --- |
| `size:XS` | 0–49 |
| `size:S` | 50–499 |
| `size:M` | 500–999 |
| `size:L` | 1000–3000 |
| `size:XL` | 3001 or more |

For example, 400 additions and 400 deletions is S; 80 additions and 1200 deletions is L. A change containing only excluded files or no text lines is XS. Binary files use the line counts returned by GitHub; the classifier does not invent line counts.

The shared policy excludes:

- `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `Cargo.lock`, `go.sum`, and `skills-lock.json` in any directory.
- `spec/docs.go`, `spec/swagger.json`, and `spec/swagger.yaml`.
- `packages/sdk/src/**`, `internal/db/postgres/sqlc/**`, and `**/*.pb.go`.
- `packages/icons/src/**`, except the handwritten `icons/Codex.vue`, `icons/CodexColor.vue`, and `icons/Misskey.vue` files.
- `apps/web/src/components/file-manager/seti/vs-seti-icon-theme.json`.

Migration SQL, tests, documentation, configuration, and icon source files count normally. A renamed file is excluded only when both its old and new paths are excluded, so moving handwritten code into a generated directory does not hide its size. The run summary reports original and filtered additions/deletions, the number of excluded files, and the resulting labels.

#### Scope Classification

Scope labels reflect changed paths and can coexist. Added, modified, and deleted files participate; renames check both paths. Generated files still participate in scope classification.

| Label | Paths |
| --- | --- |
| `change:web` | `apps/web/**`, the `packages/ui` gitlink or its contents, `packages/icons/**`, `packages/config/**`, `packages/sdk/**`, `patches/**` |
| `change:desktop` | `apps/desktop/**`, `packages/config/**` |
| `change:migrations` | `db/**/migrations/**` |
| `change:server` | `cmd/**`, `internal/**`, `conf/**`, `db/**`, `spec/**`, and root `go.mod`, `go.sum`, `sqlc.yaml`, `openapi-ts.config.ts` |

Root `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `eslint.config.mjs`, `tsconfig.json`, and `vitest.config.ts` trigger both Web and Desktop. Migrations trigger both migrations and server. Unmatched documentation or governance files may have no scope label. The classifier does not infer indirect dependencies, and labels are not CI authorization credentials.

### Templates and Evidence

Issue forms include Bug Report, Feature Request, and Help. The blank issue entry remains available. Each form starts with required Human/Agent identity and its corresponding type. The former Area and Channel fields are removed. CLI, API, and blank submissions must preserve the corresponding sections.

- Bug requires Bug Description, Steps to Reproduce, Expected and Actual Behavior, and Version.
- Feature requires Feature Description and Use Case and Motivation.
- Help requires Problem, Desired Outcome, What You Have Tried, and Version and Environment.
- All forms offer Screenshots / Recordings and Additional Context. Bug and Help also offer Logs.

The PR template requires exactly one Author and Type choice, Summary, Validation, Screenshots / Recordings, and Human QA. Related Issues is optional. PR title enforcement is outside this workflow. PR bodies in both Chinese and English are accepted. Agents should prefer Chinese when the user uses Chinese throughout the session, and write in English when the user uses English or another language, as described in [Working Language](AGENTS.md#working-language). Repository guidance, templates, and automated GitHub Actions messages use English. Only section names and choices must match the current template; the validator does not enforce a language for user-written content. Keep quoted code, error logs, and upstream material in their original language.

Empty sections, placeholders (including bare OK/done/passed), missing selections, and multiple selections receive format feedback. Subheadings inside a template section remain part of that section; only recognized template headings start another field. Fenced examples cannot supply outer section headings or choices. Content quality is not judged by a minimum word count.

Upload screenshots as GitHub-accessible attachments. For visible behavior, agents should use browser tools or Computer Use to exercise the change and capture evidence. If capture or upload is unavailable or not applicable, explain why and describe alternative verification. Local file paths are not uploaded evidence.

Human QA uses a single `- [ ] Human QA passed` status checkbox without an additional warning line. Leave it unchecked until a human explicitly confirms, then check it. Reviewer details and confirmation records are optional. The checkbox must appear in visible body text, not comments or code blocks. Agent tests and screenshots do not replace human QA; automated validation checks the declaration structure without proving that verification occurred. The validator also accepts the previous Chinese checkbox label on existing PRs.

### Workflow Behavior

`Contribution governance` uses trusted default-branch scripts. PR events use `pull_request_target`; issues use `issues`. The controller does not check out or execute PR code. It reads the current API description, validates it, synchronizes the type label, and calculates PR size/scope labels.

An invalid description receives `needs:format` and one identifiable bot comment mentioning the author and listing corrections. Editing the description triggers another check. Once corrected, the label is removed and the existing comment is updated instead of posting another one. An initially valid submission does not receive an extra success comment.

#### Independent Format Feedback and Workflow Approval

Format feedback appears through `needs:format` and the existing bot comment. The `PR Format` status always reports success, with a description distinguishing passed validation from needed corrections, so existing required-status configurations do not block code checks or merging on description format. This status only indicates that feedback was processed, not that code checks passed. The controller loads trusted default-branch rules without executing contributor code.

Code CI does not depend on format jobs or wait for the controller. Description changes do not cause the controller to cancel or rerun CI; contributors or maintainers handle test failures and manual cancellations. Existing path filters, read-only tokens, GitHub-hosted runners, and publishing permission boundaries remain unchanged. Docker PR builds still use `publish: false` and receive no publishing secrets.

Pending external-contributor workflows are still approved automatically. Approval checks the repository, PR, current head, and existing workflow allowlist independently of description format. Release, deployment, and documentation maintenance workflows are excluded. Workflow-run events and scheduled scans every five minutes reconcile approvals; authorization failures are reported explicitly.

Older PR branches may still reference `contribution-format.yml`, so its compatibility entry point remains as a no-op without description validation or status polling. A legacy `PR Format cancellation / <run id>` status is retired only on the current head when its latest record was created by `github-actions[bot]` and reports failure. Real test statuses and other accounts' statuses are preserved; historical jobs are not rerun automatically. Previously skipped or cancelled CI requires a manual rerun or a new commit.

Scheduled scans skip older PRs that predate governance and have never participated, avoiding bulk notifications. PRs created with `GITHUB_TOKEN` may not trigger ordinary PR CI; this controller does not create replacement runs. Use a GitHub App that produces normal PR events or a subsequent commit.

API operations retain bounded retries. An incomplete file list preserves existing size/scope labels and reports a classification error rather than a description error. Format feedback does not establish code trust or replace code review, merge authorization, or human QA.

#### Maintenance

Maintainers can supply a PR number to `Contribution governance` through workflow_dispatch to reconcile it. An empty input scans eligible open PRs. `Sync labels` also supports manual dispatch and writes only from main in the primary repository.

The controller adopts the new behavior only after it lands on the default branch. PR tests can verify the parser, independent CI configuration, and mocked API behavior, but cannot prove that the default-branch controller has updated. After merging, verify automatic approval, description edits, and legacy status cleanup with a real external contributor fork PR. Workflow YAML still requires normal review.

### Migration and Verification

The initial migration script is read-only by default; `--apply` explicitly enables writes:

```sh
node .github/scripts/migrate-labels.mjs felinics/Memoh /absolute/backup/directory
node .github/scripts/migrate-labels.mjs felinics/Memoh /absolute/backup/directory --apply
```

Before writing, the script saves label definitions, historical associations, and open-PR labels/classifications. It renames old size labels, applies the configuration, adds base bug/feat labels to historical regional classifications, and removes explicitly listed obsolete labels. It does not guess historical types from question/documentation labels or post comments. Finally, it recalculates size/scope labels for open PRs, skipping any PR whose head changed. Closed PR sizes are not recalculated.

The backup supports manual inspection and restoration of associations. Recreating a deleted label does not preserve its original GitHub label ID. Routine configuration synchronization does not invoke deletion logic.

Local verification:

```sh
node --test .github/scripts/*.test.mjs
# Use actionlint to validate workflow configuration.
```

Tests cover issue forms, author/type selections, nested section headings, QA declarations and notes, code blocks and comments, duplicate fields, placeholders, size classification, idempotent labels, comment reuse, current-head checks, independent workflow approval, and legacy cancellation cleanup. All ordinary PR workflows are checked for format-job dependencies.

Post-merge verification must confirm that invalid descriptions only produce feedback while code CI runs normally; description edits do not cancel or rerun CI; allowlisted workflows from real first-time contributors are still approved automatically; and legacy cancellation statuses are retired while real failures remain. Local mocked tests do not replace these checks.
